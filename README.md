## IRC

The server ships with a built-in IRC gateway so users can chat from HexChat, mIRC, or IRC bots.

1. Enable it in `.env`:

```env
IRC_ENABLED=true
IRC_PORT=6667
```

2. Connect with any IRC client:
   - **Server**: your bancho host, port `IRC_PORT` (default `6667`)
   - **Nick**: your account username (spaces replaced with `_`)
   - **Server password (PASS)**: your account password (or its MD5 hash)

Supported commands: `JOIN`, `PART`, `PRIVMSG` (channels & DMs, including `!commands`), `LIST`, `NAMES`, `TOPIC`, `WHOIS`, `WHO`, `ISON`, `MOTD`, `PING`/`PONG`, `QUIT`. Chat is fully bridged with in-game players in both directions.

#### Spectating from IRC

You can spectate a live player straight from IRC:
- `JOIN #spec_<nick>` starts spectating that player (spaces in the nick become `_`). The osu! host and any fellow spectators are notified, and spectator chat is bridged both ways.
- `PART` (any of the spectator channel names, e.g. `PART #spec_<nick>`) stops spectating. Disconnecting also stops it automatically.
- Replay frames have no IRC representation, so you follow the session through chat rather than gameplay video.

#### Multiplayer & lobby from IRC

You can also take part in multiplayer chat from IRC (handy for tournament referees):
- `JOIN #lobby` joins the multiplayer lobby chat.
- `JOIN #mp_<id> [password]` (or `JOIN #multi_<id> [password]`) joins a live match's chat by its match id. If the match is password-protected, supply the password as the channel key. Messages are bridged to and from the in-game `#multiplayer` chat, and `!mp` commands work as usual.
- `PART` the same channel name to leave.

Notes:
- Joining a match channel from IRC does not take a player slot; you are a chat participant only.
- You can be in only one match channel at a time; `PART` your current match before joining another.
- Logging in via IRC and the osu! client with the same account at the same time is possible, but a new osu! login kicks the existing session with the same user id.

## Acknowledgements

This project builds upon the work of several open-source projects and contributors. We'd like to thank:

- **[7mochi](https://github.com/7mochi)** for developing **[osu-native-jar](https://github.com/7mochi/osu-native-jar)** and **[osz2.jar](https://github.com/7mochi/osz2.jar)**.
- **[Lekuruu](https://github.com/Lekuruu)** for maintaining the excellent **[bancho-documentation](https://github.com/Lekuruu/bancho-documentation)**.
- **[osuAkatsuki](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki)** and the **[bancho.py](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/bancho.py)** project, whose database schema and parts of the server logic served as a foundation for this project (heavily modified).
- **[ekgame](https://github.com/ekgame)** for creating **[bancho-api](https://github.com/ekgame/bancho-api)**, the first Java Bancho implementation, which inspired parts of this project.
